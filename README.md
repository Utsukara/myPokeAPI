# myPokeAPI

This is a very basic implementation of the pokemon api that I intend to expand on in the future.

Implemntations:
Has the pokemon displayed after it is searched with: sprite, name, stats out of 255, and abilities.
The search bar has a search button and also has a pokeball on the left that spins when it is initially interacted with each time.
Lastly the pokemon types have specified colors to add to a more defining interface.
